<!--  Write a web page which contains a div with a blue background color 
    located on the top left corner of the page. When the mouse is over it 
    the div should move to the bottom right corner of the page. The div 
    should not jump directly to the bottom right corner. During this 
    transition, the background color of the div should transition from 
    blue to full red.
23 is the same as 24
